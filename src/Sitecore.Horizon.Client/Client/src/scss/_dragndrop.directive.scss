/*
  Prevent any child elements of a drop target to trigger drag events.

  This allows us to calculate the dragenter and dragleave phases predictably
  by only allowing those events on the drop element itself.
  This workaround has been found to be the most reliable way to understand when a drop target has a dragged element over it.

  While there are some other ways to solve it, given that browsers behave slightly different in this area.
  This solution is so far the most relibable.

  Other approches (which have proven unreliable) include:
   - Keep a count of dragenter-dragleave occurrences.
   - Ignore events where the event.target is not the drop element.
